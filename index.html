                With developed countries dumping limitles carbon pollution from factories and from vehicles into the earth's atmosphere, carbon pollution is know as cause over-heating temperatures. It is frightening ti witness overheating temperatures tearing the world apart with violence, droughts, flash floods, wild fires, tornadoes, cyclones, frigid weathers, snow-storms, dust-storms , mud slides and hurricanes. In these brutal situations, we can see horific scenes of chaos and carnage across the world.
             </p>
              <p>
                On this issue of climate change, the world peaceful society's sweeping efforts to protect the environment has started the green revolution in Africa, the beautiful and across the world. And as we all know, with trees and forests cover, we, the people shall be in a better position to withstand whatever changes or warming will bring to the world, we the people proudly call home.

             <p>
               Truly, speaking, the work to help and love one another in the world begins a new. The hope rises again. And the mission of lasting peace on earth lives on. And it will never die. And of course, the world peaceful society will conduct its works on the high plane of dignity and discipline in all parts of the world. This is because as the lasting peace on earth is our shield  and defender, we the people will be able to jump-start the idle man-power across the world.
             </p>
             <p>
               However the first chief of lasting peace on earth is firing up. His members across the world with learning a little bit about the planet earth's atmosphere. It is made up f delicately balanced blanket of gases which trap enough heat to sustain life on earth.Sadly when these fundamental gases are interfered with, they dangerously  throw the world climate out of its natural balance risking every life on earth.
             </p>
             <p>
               Surely the warmer the earth is, actually a very bad thing. This is because with a warmer earth everything gets changing causing worldwide disruption of weather patterns that humans depended on to survive for thousands of years.
